Synthetic Monitoring API Go client
==================================

This is a Go client for the API used by Grafana's [Synthetic Monitoring
application](https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-app).

For instructions about setting up Synthetic Monitoring in your Grafana
Cloud instace, please visit [the corresponding
page](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-synthetic-monitoring-app/installation).
You will need to generate a [new API
key](https://grafana.com/profile/api-keys) to initialize the app. You
can run your own [private
probes](https://github.com/grafana/synthetic-monitoring-agent).

API documentation
-----------------

Please consult the [docs/API.md](documentation for the API) that this
library accesses.
